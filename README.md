# chiasm-injector
Injects Chiasm components into existing DOM elements.

This module provides an alternative to [chiasm-layout](https://github.com/chiasm-project/chiasm-layout) that simply injects Chiasm components into existing elements on a page (typically divs) that are managed externally to Chiasm. This allows you to, for example, place charts in multiple different locations within a single page, or use layout systems such as [Bootstrap Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).

## Development flow

Run the tests with `npm test`.
